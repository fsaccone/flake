NixOS modules
-------------

- default: Provides a collection of modules to enable various things I need in
           my hosts: they are configurable through the provided 'fs'
           attribute set. See the configuration of one of my hosts to
           understand the concept better.

- home-manager: Not an actual NixOS module: it should be imported from a
                home-manager configuration. Like the 'default' NixOS module,
                it provides a collection of modules which are configurable
                through the 'fs' attribute set.
